# FDNS Stubbing Microservice

This repository contains a stubbing service for testing against the various endpoints of the FDNS Microservices. This microservice is intended to be run as a Docker container via docker-compose (or similar) to run automated tests against the endpoints in other FDNS microservices or apps.

## Notes on parameter or query values in testing

Apps running tests against this service might need to pass along parameters or required queries. If the value matters, this microservice expects you to use a string of "valid", except in the case of a Mongo ObjectId which expects a value of "sample-object-id".

The actual data passed along is rarely validated unless it would break the services. Some of the data returned is random and not related to the data passed into the query, but it is usually formatted in the way you can expect a response from the microservice.

This service can also validate against secure_mode, if required.

## Running locally

Please read the following instructions carefully for information on how to build, run and test this microservice in your local environment.

### Before you start

You will need to have the following installed before getting up and running locally:

- Docker, [Installation guides](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- Docker Compose, [Installation guides](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **Windows Users**: This project uses `Make`, please see [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) for running commands in this README

### Build

First you'll need to build the image, to do so just run the following command:

```sh
make docker-build
```

### Run

Now you'll be able to run the image, you can easily do so by running the following command:

```sh
make docker-run
```

### Test

To check if the microservice is running, just open the following URL in your browser:

[http://127.0.0.1:3002/](http://127.0.0.1:3002/)

### OAuth 2 Configuration

This microservice is configurable to emulate the endpoints with an OAuth 2 provider.

To do this, you may run

```sh
make docker-build-secure
```
